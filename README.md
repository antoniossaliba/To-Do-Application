# Apollo GraphQL Todo Web Application - Backend

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Node.js backend** for a Todo web application using **Apollo GraphQL**.  
It provides a secure and scalable API that allows users to manage their Todo lists effectively.  

The backend is built with a focus on:
- Clean and well-structured GraphQL schemas.
- Secure authentication & authorization.
- Meaningful error handling and user feedback.
- Scalability to handle many users and Todo items.

## 🎯 Goals
1. **Backend Development**: Build a Node backend for an Apollo GraphQL Todo web application.
2. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Add new Todo items.
   - Mark Todo items as completed or not completed.
   - Delete Todo items.
3. **UI Integration**: Use Figma design references to build effective endpoints that support the frontend.
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure meaningful feedback for all user interactions.
5. **Security**: Apply best practices for authentication and authorization to protect user data.
6. **Scalability**: Ensure the backend can scale to handle a high number of users and Todo items.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Node.js** – Backend runtime environment.
- **Apollo Server (GraphQL)** – Query language and server for API.
- **Express.js** – Middleware for handling HTTP requests.
- PostgreSQL** – Database
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** – Authentication & Authorization.
- **Bcrypt.js** – Password hashing for secure storage.

⚡ Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/To-Do-Application.git
   cd To-Do-Application

2. Install Dependencies
   npm install

3. Run the Server
   npm start

4. Access GraphQL Playground / localhost
   http://localhost:4000/graphql
   http://localhost:3000

🔒 Security

Passwords are hashed before storage.

JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.

Role-based authorization (extendable).

Protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks).

📈 Scalability Considerations

Stateless authentication via JWT.

Horizontal scaling with Docker/Kubernetes.

Database indexing for optimized queries.

Caching layer (e.g., Redis) for performance.
